#A space for each individual member to log recent things they've been working on, be it research, design, or coding. Meant to keep other team members in the loop.

- Wrote class box icon and accompanying dialog box.
- Will be writing text box icon soon.  It's basically the same thing as the class box, but with only one box.

Have menu's working properly, Tabs are now tracked and restored on switches to their previous creation states.  Line Creation mode and Shape Creation mode are now mutually exclusive.  Line creation now continues even after making a line.  Working on deletion still, the basics of it are working, still has weird/random crashes I haven't identified.

Deletion is working for objects WITHOUT lines attached to them and WITHOUT line creation turned on.  DragScene now has a public void deleteItem(Icon**item) function.**

finished the note and rounded square. I also added a run time window icon to test the load path of images and i kind of like it just let me know what you guys think. Also on windows running it through qtcreator you have to put the icon folder in the runtime folder which is normally different than the source folder, can someone try it and let me know if its the same on other systems or if you know any fixes to it?

- 3/14: Worked on editing all code so that it matches our guidelines; #1 is complete, but I had issues with QT and have to re-download/install it before I can finish the job. Fantastic.

## Adrian Norris ##
Finished up basic solid line with Alex and uploaded the code to the repo. Will now work on changing the current architecture in to the final architecture along with adding other line options.
